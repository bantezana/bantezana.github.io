								<div class="image main"><img src="images/prov.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Born and raised in Provedence Rhode Island, seeking out
									the best of my abilities to learn in the smallest state 
									in USA. Having the priviledge to been taught by The University of Rhode Island
									and Brown University, my knowledge has grown to a point where 
									I still hunger for more.
								</p>
								<p>Studied Computer Engineering and humbly worked with professors
									in University of Rhode Isalnd, where it helped me paint a bigger picture
									on  what I want to do. I worked on real life projects with graduate
									students who were working with the latest tachnology alongside with professors. I soon 
									began to realize my passionate to work on for the rest of my life, which is to develop/engineer 
									new and creative ideas that can cultivate
									easier work flow and to help society.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/uriPic.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>School was challanging and throughout the years I saw
									the number of students in my class began to dwindle quickily.
									The difference between me and the other students is how determined
									I was and having the thought of never giving up. There were cases where subjects
									can be overwhelming and projects unsolvable, but working and studying
									day and night has made me increase my endurance to finish tasks and solving
									problems efficiently. Understanding materials thoroughly and executing
									projects proficiently with the benefits from the University's resources.
									I hope to bring the desirable necesities and the talent 
									to the position
									I enter.
